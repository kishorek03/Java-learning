//Key Takeaways:

//SRP: Break down classes so each has only one reason to change
//OCP: Design classes to be extendable without modification (use interfaces/abstraction)
//LSP: Subclasses should extend parent classes without changing their behavior
//ISP: Create specific interfaces rather than general-purpose ones
//DIP: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations


//Following these principles leads to more flexible, maintainable systems
